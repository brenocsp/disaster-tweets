# Natural Language Processing for Disaster Tweets

Twitter is an important mean of communication nowadays. On that platform, it is possible for different groups to be heard around the world in real time. In times of emergency, that possibility becomes even more relevant.

Because of this, more aid and news agencies are interested in monitoring Twitter. But it is not always clear whether a person's words are really about disasters. That problem stems from the fact that human language is ambiguous and context dependent.

Therefore, this project will explore the problem of classifying a set of texts originating from Twitter. These tweets can be of two classes: about real disaster cases, or not.
